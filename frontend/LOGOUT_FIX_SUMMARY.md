# Admin Logout Navigation Fix

## Issue Fixed ✅
**Problem:** When admin logs out, they were being navigated to the website landing page (`/`) instead of the admin login page.

**Root Cause:** The `handleLogout` function in `DashboardHeader.jsx` was calling `navigate('/')` instead of `navigate('/admin/login')`.

## Solution Applied

### File Modified: `frontend/src/components/admin/DashboardHeader.jsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
const handleLogout = () => {
  authService.logout();
  navigate('/');  // ❌ Wrong - goes to landing page
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const handleLogout = () => {
  authService.logout();
  navigate('/admin/login');  // ✅ Correct - goes to admin login
};
```

## Verification

### Current Routing Structure
- `/` - Main products page (customer-facing)
- `/admin/login` - Admin login page
- `/admin/dashboard` - Admin dashboard (protected)
- `/owner/register` - Admin registration

### Components Checked
1. ✅ **DashboardHeader.jsx** - Fixed logout navigation
2. ✅ **auth.service.js** - Only clears localStorage (correct behavior)
3. ✅ **ProtectedRoute.jsx** - Already redirects to `/admin/login` when not authenticated
4. ✅ **App.jsx** - Routing structure is correct

### Expected Behavior After Fix
1. Admin clicks "Logout" button in dashboard header
2. `authService.logout()` clears localStorage (token and admin data)
3. Navigation redirects to `/admin/login`
4. Admin sees the login form and can log back in

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Log in as admin and access the dashboard
2. Click the "Logout" button in the top-right corner
3. Verify you are redirected to the admin login page (`/admin/login`)
4. Verify you can log back in successfully

## Additional Security
The `ProtectedRoute` component ensures that if someone tries to access `/admin/dashboard` without being authenticated, they are automatically redirected to `/admin/login`, providing an additional layer of security.

## Status: ✅ FIXED
Admin logout now correctly navigates to the admin login page instead of the customer landing page.
