# E-Commerce Application Summary

This document summarizes the key aspects of the e-commerce application based on the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD), Technical Specifications, and AI Assistant Implementation Prompt.

## 1. Project Overview

The e-commerce platform aims to revolutionize online shopping through immersive 3D product visualization, streamlined guest checkout processes, and comprehensive administrative tools. It addresses the growing demand for interactive online shopping experiences while maintaining high standards of performance, security, and code quality. The platform supports both Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Business (B2B) use cases.

## 2. Key Features

*   **3D Product Visualization**: Interactive 3D models of products, allowing customers to examine items from every angle. Implemented using Three.js and React Three Fiber.
*   **Guest Checkout**: Eliminates the need for mandatory account creation, reducing cart abandonment rates.
*   **Comprehensive Administrative Tools**: For product management, order processing, customer communication, and business analytics.
*   **Multi-vendor Platform**: Admins can register and sell products, with a commission structure of 7% platform fee and 93% directly to the admin's bank account.
*   **Direct Bank Transfers**: Automated transfers to admin bank accounts after successful payments.
*   **Dynamic Category System**: With customizable input fields for flexible product data management.
*   **Real-time Inventory Management**: Prevents overselling and ensures accurate product availability.
*   **Push Notifications**: Via Firebase Cloud Messaging for order updates and marketing campaigns.
*   **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices, including a 2x2 product grid layout on desktop.

## 3. Technology Stack

*   **Frontend**: React.js
*   **3D Graphics**: Three.js, React Three Fiber, React Three Drei
*   **Backend**: Express.js (Node.js)
*   **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time features)
*   **Image & Video Management**: Cloudinary
*   **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging
*   **Payment Processing**: Paystack
*   **State Management**: Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, Local Storage, Context API

## 4. Architecture Requirements

The application follows a modern, scalable three-tier architecture with additional microservice patterns for third-party integrations. A critical constraint is the **strict 100-line limit per file** across all components (React components, Express.js route files, service files, utility functions, configuration files). This promotes modularity, readability, and maintainability.

### Backend Structure (Express.js)

The backend is organized into `controllers`, `services`, `middleware`, `routes`, `utils`, and `config` directories, each adhering to the 100-line limit. Key API endpoints include authentication, product management, category management, order management, and payment processing.

### Frontend Structure (React.js)

The frontend is structured with `components`, `pages`, `hooks`, `services`, `utils`, and `store` directories, also adhering to the 100-line limit. It leverages React Three Fiber for 3D rendering and Redux Toolkit for global state management.

### Database Schema (Supabase)

Core tables include `users`, `categories`, `products`, `orders`, `order_items`, `admins`, and `transfers`. The schema supports the multi-vendor model, commission calculation, and direct bank transfers.

## 5. Implementation Priorities (Phased Approach)

1.  **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**: Setup backend with Supabase, admin registration with bank details, Paystack transfer recipient creation, basic product CRUD, and dynamic category system.
2.  **Phase 2: Customer Experience**: Build React frontend with product listing (2x2 grid), 3D product viewer, guest checkout, Paystack payment integration, and order management.
3.  **Phase 3: Payment Automation**: Implement automatic transfer system, transfer tracking, admin dashboard with transfer history, push notifications for order updates, and comprehensive error handling.
4.  **Phase 4: Advanced Features**: Product search and filtering, inventory management, analytics and reporting, bulk product operations, and performance optimization.

## 6. Critical Success Factors

*   Strict adherence to the **100-line file limit**.
*   Seamless **direct bank transfers** to admin accounts.
*   Correct implementation of the **2x2 product grid** and responsive design.
*   Optimized **guest checkout** for conversion.
*   Smooth performance of **3D visualization** across devices.
*   Accurate **7%/93% commission split** calculations.
*   Comprehensive **error handling** for payment flows.
*   Robust **security** (PCI compliance, data protection).
*   High **performance** (fast loading times, smooth interactions).
*   Excellent **mobile optimization**.
